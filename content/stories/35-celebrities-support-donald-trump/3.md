The Hollywood A-lister and star of cult hits like Wedding Crashers and Zoolander was asked about Trump in an interview. Despite being a staunch liberal he confessed. “You can’t help but get a kick out of him, and I think part of it is we’re so used to politicians on both sides sounding like actors at press junkies—it’s sort of by rote, and they say all the right things,”

Wilson laughed. “So here’s somebody who’s not following that script. It’s like when Charlie Sheen was doing that stuff—like, wow! He’s answering a question completely honestly, and in an entertaining way. You sort of feel he could be a character from Network.”
